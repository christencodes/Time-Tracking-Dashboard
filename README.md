## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

JSON. JSON. JSON. Prior to this challenge I used the MDN Documentation to learn the basic of JSON. That short tutorial, some light practice, and Frontend Mentor's introduction to JSON thoroughly prepared me for this challenge.

- I learned how to use JSON with a local file.
- I learned how to structure my HTML and CSS more effectively
  -I learned that breaking down complex JS issues into bite sized ones is the most effective

### Continued development

Things I want to work on:

- Mobile First Design
- JSON
- Javascript
- CSS selectors and specificity

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/JSON) - This helped me learn the JSON basics!
